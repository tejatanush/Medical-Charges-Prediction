# Medical-Charges-Prediction  
This model is capable of predicting if Medical Chrges prediction based on features like age,BMI, Gender, Smoking, No.of Children..etc . This helps people to get a visualization of how much they will charge lifetime for their health condition. Hospitals and clinics also be helpful by providing information about patient charges quickly.
